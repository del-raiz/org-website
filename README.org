#+SUBTITLE: My Personal Website

* Introduction

I originally built this website with the idea of using TypeScript to build a website from scratch, and I set up the build utilizing Gulp.js and webpack, however, due to my neglect the current system is quite outdated.

After my adventures of deep-diving into all things Emacs related, I have become quite competent in Emacs Lisp as well as the infamous Org Mode, as well as many other things. This led me to pursue a personal website that is built entirely in an Emacs Lisp framework, utilizing Org Mode to publish my website - I have yet to figure out how all this works, but for now this is the first step by turning my README into an Org file.
