* Overview

This is the very beginnings of my [[https://github.com/skribest/org-website][org-website]] written in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs Lisp]] and powered by [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]]!

More to come content-wise in the /Cosmetic Chemistry/ space, and of course my adventures in all things *Emacs*, so stay tuned...  But first we must set up the infrastructure.

In the meantime, see below for references that helped set the foundation of my work.
