* Overview

Welcome to the early beginnings of my personal [[https://github.com/skribest/org-website][website]] built in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] written in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html][Emacs Lisp]].

I am currently working on my build using Org and Emacs and some Emacs Lisp tools I will be writting for the development of this website.. Once I have this stage complete, I will then begin to work on generating content.

I would like to have a section focused on the /Cosmetic Chemistry/ space, ofcourse Emacs and Lisp programming (as I learn it), a personal Blog, and my CV, and a list of my projects I am actively developing, so stay tuned...

Below is a rough outline of some of the content I would like to fill in.


* Projects

Here is a list of the projects that I am actively working on:

** Emacs

- This Website - my personal website, curriculum vitae, blog, and more...

- Emacs Lisp Utilities & Personal Configuration

- Chembook.org (chembook.el) - a project I am still defining out, more to come

** Cosmetic Chemistry /Theoretically/

- Sneak Peak at upcoming show notes:
  - "The HLB System: The Basics"
  - "The HLB System: Advanced Concepts"
  - "The HLB System: Empirical vs Theoretical"
  - "Let's get Surface-Active: The Basics"
  - "Let's get Surface-Active: Detergents"
  - "Let's get Surface-Active: Emulsifiers"
