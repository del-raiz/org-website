* Overview

This is the very beginnings of my [[https://github.com/skribest/org-website][website]] built in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] written in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html][Emacs Lisp]].

More to come content-wise in the /Cosmetic Chemistry/ space, and of course my adventures in all things *Emacs*, so stay tuned...  But first we must set up the infrastructure.

In the meantime, see below for references that helped set the foundation of my work.


* Projects

Here is a list of the projects that I am actively working on:

** Emacs

- This Website - my personal website, curriculum vitae, blog, and perhaps more

- Emacs Lisp Utilities & Personal Configuration

- Chembook.org (chembook.el) - a project I am still defining out, more to come

** Cosmetic Chemistry

- Cosmetic Chemistry - Theoretically (proposed YouTube Channel)

- Sneak Peak at upcoming show notes:
  - "The HLB System: The Basics"
  - "The HLB System: Advanced Concepts"
